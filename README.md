## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project is actually one I had done in the past but not well so I decided to go back and do it again. Furthermore, it was done back when "import" and "use" were the the standard practice in sass so I wanted to redo it so it was closer to the design and update the project to conform to current sass standards. But, in the interest of keeping the original submission on frontendmentor for posterity, I decided to just make a brand new repository rather than a branch.

### Continued development

I want to focus on refining my abilities with SASS. Lately I seem to be leaning more towards SASS than vanilla CSS so getting better at it seems like a good approach to me.
